This will be a tool (or collection of tools) to read data from the slurm
scheduling logs / accounting database and generate useful data.

The plan is to be able to provide:
text based aggragration of information
text grapical aggragration of information
image aggragration of information

If I really feel saucy, an interactive web front end for all of this for real time generation of requests.
